    "Vintage 1970s monster-comic poster aesthetic featuring a muscular anthropomorphic frog hero "
    "with exaggerated anatomy, thick black ink outlines, bold cel-shaded shadows, gritty halftone "
    "print texture, rough pulp-comic finish, glowing orange eyes, and a limited palette of green, "
    "orange, deep blue, and black. Fiery explosive backgrounds with energy waves or stormy skies. "
    "No realism, no glossy surfaces, no 3D, no robots, no mechs, no manga, no Disney, no CGI. Must "
    "always remain a frog-based humanoid (MegaGrok) with heroic posture and intense retro ink energy."
