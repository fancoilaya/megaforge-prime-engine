MEGAGROK_STYLE = """
Vintage MegaGrok comic-poster style. Muscular anthropomorphic frog hero with thick black ink lines, bold shadows, glowing orange eyes, exaggerated heroic anatomy. 1970s monster-comic art with gritty halftone texture and explosive fiery orange backgrounds. Limited palette: green, orange, deep blue, black. Heavy retro shading, intense energy waves, dramatic stance. No realism, no 3D, no robots, no modern CGI. Style reference: MegaGrok Evolution posters, MegaPump, MegaBullish, Mint Machine.
