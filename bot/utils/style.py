MEGAGROK UNIVERSE — FIXED STYLE BLOCK  
(Do NOT override these rules.)

ART STYLE:
• Vintage 1970s monster-comic poster aesthetic  
• Muscular anthropomorphic frog hero (MegaGrok) with exaggerated anatomy  
• Thick black ink outlines, heavy retro cross-hatching  
• Bold cel-shaded shadows, strong contrast  
• Gritty halftone print texture  
• Hand-painted pulp-comic look, slightly rough and worn  

COLOR PALETTE:
• Green (skin), orange (eyes, chest, energy), red/orange fire tones  
• Deep navy/blue shadows  
• No metallic or neon colors  
• Absolutely no glossy or realistic shading  

CHARACTER RULES:
• Must always be a frog-based humanoid (never a robot, mech, alien, human or animal other than frog)  
• MegaGrok has glowing orange eyes and heroic proportions  
• Hands and feet must be frog-like, not mechanical  
• Expression: confident, heroic, powerful  

BACKGROUND:
• Fiery explosive orange glow, energy waves, cosmic clouds, or dramatic stormy skies  
• Poster-style flat gradients with halftone dots  
• No realism, no photographs, no 3D rendering  

WHAT TO AVOID:
• No robots, no mechs, no sci-fi armor  
• No realistic lighting or CGI  
• No glossy surfaces  
• No modern comic styles  
• No manga/anime, no Pixar, no Disney look  
• No smooth 3D shading  

OUTPUT FEEL:
• Looks like a limited-edition retro monster-comic poster  
• Printed ink texture, bold typography energy
