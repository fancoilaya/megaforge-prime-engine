OFFICIAL MEGAGROK POSTER STYLE — FINALIZED FROM CANON ARTWORK
(Do NOT override. This defines the visual identity of the MegaGrok Universe.)

CORE STYLE:
• Retro 1970s monster-comic poster aesthetics  
• Thick black ink linework with heavy outlines  
• Bold cel-shading with strong contrast  
• Deep, gritty halftone print textures  
• Slightly worn, pulp-comic paper feel  
• High-energy explosive backgrounds in fiery orange tones  

CHARACTER DESIGN — MUST MATCH CANON POSTERS:
• Anthropomorphic frog superhero (MegaGrok)  
• Body: extremely muscular heroic proportions  
• Chest: orange/tan torso plates (NOT smooth gradient)  
• Eyes: glowing orange or amber, large, expressive  
• Face: wide frog mouth, friendly/aggressive comic expression  
• Hands/feet: frog-like, thick, strong, NEVER human-like  
• Always a *frog superhero*, never a creature, monster, robot, alien, lizard, or humanoid with wrong proportions  
• NO robots, NO armor, NO mechs, NO sci-fi suits  

COLOR PALETTE — LOCKED:
• Skin: saturated green with dark blue shading  
• Chest/eyes/energy: bright orange  
• Shadows: deep navy/blue  
• Background: orange fire, smoke, heatwaves  
• Typography: bold retro poster yellow/orange  

BACKGROUND RULES:
• Fiery explosive backgrounds with swirling energy rings  
• Lava-like orange-red glow  
• Dramatic cosmic clouds or rocky terrain  
• No realism, no photographic elements, no CGI  

COMPOSITION RULES:
• Classic pulp poster framing  
• Character fills 70% of the frame  
• Dynamic heroic poses (charging forward, flexing, leaping, fighting)  
• The ground often cracking or erupting beneath him  
• High dramatic lighting from behind  

TEXT RULES:
• Do NOT add any text unless the USER specifically asks  
• No random symbols or fake letters  
• When text IS requested: bold blocky retro poster typography  

WHAT TO AVOID COMPLETELY:
• Robots, armor, metal, guns, sci-fi gear  
• Realistic lighting or smooth CGI  
• Disney/Pixar/Anime/Manga style  
• Slim frog proportions or deformed body shapes  
• Soft gradients or glossy rendering  
• Modern comic styles or 3D render look  

THE VIBE:
• Looks exactly like the official MegaGrok posters uploaded  
• Powerful, heroic, explosive, energetic  
• Retro, analog, ink-heavy, comic-poster printing look  
• Strong orange fire behind a green heroic frog superhero  

This style block always applies BEFORE the user idea.
